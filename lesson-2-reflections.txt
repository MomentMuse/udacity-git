//What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a hidden .git folder to keep track of your changes. This will allow you to keep track of commits on your files.

//How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Working directory: your local files that you are working on
Repository: committed or finalized directory, as hosted on github
Staging area: an intermediary step between the two, like a "soft save", but you're not sure if you want to commit to the changes yet.
